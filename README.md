Deadwood board game repository

This Java-based board game can be played by downloading the main zip file with all the code, a readme is attached in there to show you how to play.

In this master branch I have also uploaded all the .java files so you can see the code. I refrained from uploading all the .png files and other unecessary ones to showcase but they are all in the .zip file for playing the game.
